## Pythagorean Calculation and Triangle Determination (PCTD)
PCTP is a program that helps you calculate the Pythagorean theorem and determine whether three sides can form a triangle. 

All you need to do is follow the "入门" section of the Help menu to get the tutorial. It is currently only available in Chinese.

For those who don't have Python installed on their computers, I've packaged a .exe program for them to use.

FOR SOME REASON, SOME BUGS WILL NOT BE FIXED.
